    <h6 style="text-align: center;">I plan to fill this blog with my daily activities and lesson I learn during my life as a PhD student. 
    For students doing who are in process of doing a PhD my hope is that the hard lessons i'll undoubtedly
  learn throughout my 4 years will can help you. For people who are thinking about starting a PhD, this may be 
able to give you a taste of what being a PhD student entails. In short, I hope this blog can be useful to someone!</h6>

  <h6 style="color: rgb(16, 134, 89);">25/02/2021</h6>
  Hello to anyone (if anyone) reading this! After coming up to 6 months of being a PhD student I realised that even though I 
  have read a lot of books and papers, I still haven't begun a specific written piece of work for my thesis. My PhD project is 
  titlted "transfer optimization for highly configurable software", so in short my focus is high dimensional or many-objective problems. 
  So today I began my plan to carry out a literature review on high-dimensional problems in Evolutioanry Computation and Bayesian Optimization.
  For high-dimensional evolutionary computation, which is typically above 50, methods can be split into two core categories, decomposition and non-decomposition. 
  Decomposotion of a problem involves splitting the high-dimensional objective vector into sub-components and optimize each sub-component 
  individually. The non-decomposition methods involve dimension reduction and enhanced search operators. Within the Bayesian Optimization 
  framework, high-dimensional problems are considered to be problems over 20 dimensions, as work has shown that Bayesian Optimization 
  significantly loses performance beyond 20 dimensions. From the papers I have read, it seems that methods overcoming apply a single or
  possible combination of Dimension Reduction, Kernel Enhancment or Decomposition (such as additive models) methods. My current opinion is that methods of 
  the ideas of dealing with high-dimensions in Evolutioanry Computation and Bayesian Optimization are similar but are implemented using 
  different methodologies, i.e. Bayesian Optimization is heavily used in the Machine Learning field, and their implementations involve a lot
  of mathematics whereas Evolutionary Computation techniques are more of intuitive approaches, that is they apply changes to the Evolutionary
  Algorithm itself. My aim for this literature review will be to see if there are areas of dealing with high dimensionality within the two 
  field that can be used/exploited in the other area. For example, in a Bayesian Optimization, can Large-Scale Evolutionary Computation 
  algorithms be used to better optimize the Acquisition Function and would that bring improved performance to the average Bayesian Optimization
  algorithm for a problem more than 20-dimensions.

    Hello to anyone (if anyone) reading this! As you can tell this is my very first PhD blog entry. I actually started 
    my PhD in September 2019, so i'm coming up to my first 6 months, and what I can say is, it goes fast...very fast! 
    The biggest thing I felt when I started my course is concern, I was concerned if this was the right thing for me and
    the thought of it being 4 years of reading difficult papers is scary! My advice to myself 6 months ago starting as PhD
    student wouold be to focus on learning the "basics". Dont focus on reading paper after paper, instead read books in your field, for me 
    I read books that took you from complete beginner to intermediate and then try to build on this through papers and even 
    more books!! Once you get to a decent level of understanding try and start implementing algorithms that have been covered 
    by a book you've read. Obviously not all the algorithms! But a great to get a solid understanding of how something works is to
    implement it yourself, most of my github right now are from books and probably not totally correct! To end this entry of my first
    6 months, the word that describes my first and probably a lot of students first 6 months is perseverance, even though it is difficult 
    at the start, and you may be struggling to understand the content of these books, in the famous words of Dory, just keep swimming! 
    If you can perservere and keep reading the books and the endless googling for tutorials that to better understand some of the topics 
    it will click in your mind and things will start to make more sense! Until the next entry, hwyl fawr!
