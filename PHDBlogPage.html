    <h6 style="text-align: center;">I plan to fill this blog with my daily activities and lesson I learn during my life as a PhD student. 
    For students doing who are in process of doing a PhD my hope is that the hard lessons i'll undoubtedly
  learn throughout my 4 years will can help you. For people who are thinking about starting a PhD, this may be 
able to give you a taste of what being a PhD student entails. In short, I hope this blog can be useful to someone!</h6>

      <p>
        Hello to anyone (if anyone) reading this! So as the title probably suggests this entry is about how using external libraries in python can be nearly as 
        complicated as implement the algorithm from scratch! Most computer scientists would probably support my claim that debugging your code can be one of the 
        most fustrating, soul destroying and tedious process. In my case I'm using the pytorch library in combination with my own code to create an algorithm
        in the Bayesian Optimization framework. I kept getting the error "Expected Double but got float", and after hours, I mean hours of trying to convert the 
        data I generate to the pytorch.double type, going through the pytorch source code itself and endless googling I finally found a solution to my problem! 
        When you evetually find a solution to this or find the couse of the problem, in general I am filled with two emotions, a great sense of relief but also 
        fustration and how simple the solution was. In this particular case all was required was me to set the model to accept float values by using model = model.float(). 
        I must stress that as I am new to the pytorch library it is definetly something I will remember and use again and again, so the hours trying to solve this 
        was worth it (i think!) Anyway thats the end of my blog entry, hopefully this entry shows that youre not alone in getting annoying bugs in your code that at first
        you dont know how to solve :)

      <p>
        Hello to anyone (if anyone) reading this! After coming up to 6 months of being a PhD student I realised that even though I 
        have read a lot of books and papers, I still haven't begun a specific written piece of work for my thesis. My PhD project is 
        titlted "transfer optimization for highly configurable software", so in short my focus is high dimensional or many-objective problems. 
        So today I began my plan to carry out a literature review on high-dimensional problems in Evolutioanry Computation and Bayesian Optimization.
        For high-dimensional evolutionary computation, which is typically above 50, methods can be split into two core categories, decomposition and non-decomposition. 
        Decomposotion of a problem involves splitting the high-dimensional objective vector into sub-components and optimize each sub-component 
        individually. The non-decomposition methods involve dimension reduction and enhanced search operators. Within the Bayesian Optimization 
        framework, high-dimensional problems are considered to be problems over 20 dimensions, as work has shown that Bayesian Optimization 
        significantly loses performance beyond 20 dimensions. From the papers I have read, it seems that methods overcoming apply a single or
        possible combination of Dimension Reduction, Kernel Enhancment or Decomposition (such as additive models) methods. My current opinion is that methods of 
        the ideas of dealing with high-dimensions in Evolutioanry Computation and Bayesian Optimization are similar but are implemented using 
        different methodologies, i.e. Bayesian Optimization is heavily used in the Machine Learning field, and their implementations involve a lot
        of mathematics whereas Evolutionary Computation techniques are more of intuitive approaches, that is they apply changes to the Evolutionary
        Algorithm itself. My aim for this literature review will be to see if there are areas of dealing with high dimensionality within the two 
        field that can be used/exploited in the other area. For example, in a Bayesian Optimization, can Large-Scale Evolutionary Computation 
        algorithms be used to better optimize the Acquisition Function and would that bring improved performance to the average Bayesian Optimization
        algorithm for a problem more than 20-dimensions.

        Hello to anyone (if anyone) reading this! As you can tell this is my very first PhD blog entry. I actually started 
        my PhD in September 2019, so i'm coming up to my first 6 months, and what I can say is, it goes fast...very fast! 
        The biggest thing I felt when I started my course is concern, I was concerned if this was the right thing for me and
        the thought of it being 4 years of reading difficult papers is scary! My advice to myself 6 months ago starting as PhD
        student wouold be to focus on learning the "basics". Dont focus on reading paper after paper, instead read books in your field, for me 
        I read books that took you from complete beginner to intermediate and then try to build on this through papers and even 
        more books!! Once you get to a decent level of understanding try and start implementing algorithms that have been covered 
        by a book you've read. Obviously not all the algorithms! But a great to get a solid understanding of how something works is to
        implement it yourself, most of my github right now are from books and probably not totally correct! To end this entry of my first
        6 months, the word that describes my first and probably a lot of students first 6 months is perseverance, even though it is difficult 
        at the start, and you may be struggling to understand the content of these books, in the famous words of Dory, just keep swimming! 
        If you can perservere and keep reading the books and the endless googling for tutorials that to better understand some of the topics 
        it will click in your mind and things will start to make more sense! Until the next entry, hwyl fawr!
