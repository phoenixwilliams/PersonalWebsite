        Thank you for visiting my website! Here you can find some information about myself, my PhD studies and some of my interests. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neath">Neath, South Wales</a> i'm 
        a previous student of Ysgol Gynradd Castell-Nedd and <a href="https://www.ysgolystalyferabrodur.cymru/en/">Ysgol Gyfun Ystalyfera</a>. At 18 I joined the University of Exeter to study my BSc and MSc (integrated degree)
        in Computer Science and Mathematics, and stared my PhD course in September 2020 under the supervision of <a href="https://cola-laboratory.github.io">Dr Ke Li</a> (Cola-Lab).</p>
      <p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My PhD research is focused on Transfer Optimization and High-Dimensional Problems, with the aim of applying transfer learning techniques to achieve improved the performance in 
        optimizing High-Dimensional (Large-Scale) problems. During my undergraduate and masters course, my research revolved around Evolutionary Music Generation, that is the application of 
        Evolutionary Algorithms for music generation, this is an area that is still of great interest to me.

    <h1>My Reasons for maintaining this website</h1>    
    <p>To students who are curious about why someone would spend their time to maintain such a website like this:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Personal Developement</dt>
      <dd>- Web developement is something I enjoy and this website allows me to express some creativity whilst also devloping a practical skill.</dd>
      <dd>- Maintaining a website on my PhD studies gives me more motivation to read and better my understanding of the field. My <a href="ResourcesGettingStartedpage.html">Resources</a> 
        shows the books / papers I have read since I started by PhD, so the more papers I read the more impressive it looks aha!</dd>
      <dd> - Maintaining a blog I feel is good way for self-reflection, either after a period of time or whilst writting it. Seeing what me days have consisted I can reflect 
          and decide if I need to change anything about my work routine.
      </dd>
      <dt>For future employers and oppertunities</dt>
      <dd>
          - Maintaining this website with resources, code and interests will hopefully demonstrate the kind of student/worker I am and the work I've carried more clearly 
          than a long paragraph on a CV could do.
      </dd>
      <dd>
          - Beyond my PhD I will undoubtidly be going into the job market, sharing this website on social media (such as LinkedIn) or my CV will cut my out of the crowd 
          and improve my chances during the hiring process. 
      </dd>

      <dt>Being a part and helping the reasearch community (personally the most important one to me)</dt>
      <dd>
            - Carrying out publishable work is the aim of every researcher, but when good work is carried out, I believe it should not be hidden from others for personal gain 
            but shared to inspire other researchers to improve and build on your work.
      </dd>
      <dd>
            - I feel that too frequently researchers decide to not share code used for their published paper, and so makes it difficult for other researchers to implement their
            algorithm and be confident the implementation is totally correct. 
       </dd>
       <dd>
        - To support the openess of source codes used for published papers, links to my Github repository of any published paper or implemented Algorithms
         will be held on this website in my <a href="CodePage.html">Code</a> page with the corresponding paper.  
       </dd>
       <dd>
           - For any researchers that wants to get into fields that I am currently working on, I hope that this website can be a useful tool for you to access resources that can 
           better your understanding of the field and lead to publishable work of your own!
