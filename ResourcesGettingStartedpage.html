      <h5>Multi-Objective Optimization using Evolutionary Algorithms.</h5>
      <h6>By K.Deb</h6>
      <p>
        This book is a great start to evolutionary algoirithms for optimisation problems. Where single objective have a single optimum you want to find, multi-objective 
        problems can have objectives that effect eachother and an improvement in one objective may reduce the performance in another, this forming a set of non-domianted solutions.
        This is a set of solution where each solution can be considered to be better or worse than a solution in the set.

      <h5>Machine Learning: An algorithmic Perspective: Second Edition.</h5>
        <h6>By Stephen Marsland</h6>
        <p>
          This book is great for new researchers who (as I was/still am) are unexperienced working with and implemnting
          machine learning algorithms. This book not only offers good descriptions of different algorithms but also 
          implmenetations in Python. Personally, the Gaussian Process section was very helpful especially when computing 
          log-likelihood.

      <h5>Mathematics for Machine Learning.</h5>
      <h6>By Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal and Cheng Soon Ong</h6>
        <p>
          This book is about the mathematics of machine learning, it begins by taking you through the "basics" of math in machine learning that should 
          give you a solid base to understanding machine learning papers and the mathematics that they use / talk about. After the "basics" is covered 
          the book goes on to applying the math to machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Dimensionality Reduction, Distribution Estimation 
          and ending with the good old support vector machines. If what I just said makes no sense to you, basically this book will give you solid math 
          base for machine learning, but it can be a tough read for those who haven't studies much mathematics.

      <h5>Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning.</h5>
      <h6>By C. E. Rasmussen and C. K. I. Williams</h6>
      <p>
        As the title suggests, this book is purely about Gaussian Processes in Machine Learning. The book can be seperated into three core focuses, Gaussian Process for Regression, 
        Gaussian Process for classification and the application of Gaussian Processes. Whereas Machine Learning: An algorithms Perspective is useful 
        for the Python implementation, this books gives detailed and clear mathematical proofs and equations of how a 
        Gaussian Process works and how to predict new data.

      <h5>Dive into Deep Learning.</h5>
      <h6>By Aston Zhang, Zack C. Liption, Mu Li and Alex J. Smola</h6>
      <p>
        This book, as it says in the title, dives you into deep learning. Where the previous machine learning books introduce you to the math and basic machine learning algorithms, 
        this books focuses on neural networks. The book begins with linear models but quickly moves on to more complex neural networks involved in image tasks such as 
        classification and natural language programming. The great thing about this book is that it not only talks you through the algorithm but the authors provide 
        comprehensive Python notebooks for each chapter with the examples they go through. Access their website using the <a href="https://d2l.ai/d2l-en.pdf">Website</a> link.

      <h5>Learning From Data.</h5>
      <h6>By Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Hsuan-Tien Lin</h6>
      <p>
        This book is from the series of lectures by Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa of Caltech Univeristy, US. Clicking the <a href="https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse">Webpage</a>
        link you can follow the series of lectures on YouTube. During the beginning of research, it can be a little frustrating to just be constantly reading, so 
        watching the lectures online was a welcomes break from constantly reading from the screen. The series takes you from the beginning of machine learning
        concluding with a linear model. Even though most books being with the linear model, this series goes into extreme detail of every aspect from getting 
        the data to having a trained and tested model. I would suggest this is a great book/lecture series to introduce yourself to machine learning.

      <h5>Learning From Data. (Not completed)</h5>
      <h6>By Bernhard Scholkopf and Alexander J. Smola</h6>
      <p>
        Kernels are very important in Machine Learning. In brief, a kernel is used to calculate the distance between two solutions. An example of the use and power of kernels
        comes with trying to apply a linear classification model to a non-linear set of data. Applying a kernel on the data cant also be thought as mapping the data to a 
        different space. In this space the once non-linear dataset is now completely linear, and a simple linear model can be used effectively. WARNING: This book does contain 
        some complex math. Currently I have not finished reading this book, but will update this text once I have.
