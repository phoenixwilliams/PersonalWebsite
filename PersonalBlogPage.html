  <h6 style="color: rgb(16, 134, 89);">25/02/2021</h6>
  Hi everyone (well im assuming atleast one person will read this), so as a person I'm always thinking of ways I can make 
  passive income (and to date I have no methods), but I found out that your can upload books to Amazon Kindle for free! 
  (well Amazon get some royalities) So in short, I come from quite a creative family, my mothers a musician, dads and full-time artist 
  my sister is like a wizzz on the Harp and Piano and plays for the UK National Youth Orchestra (<a href="https://www.nyo.org.uk/">link here</a>).
  One of the things I think has gone un-noticed during this Pandemic, or even something that has been given not much attention is the affect 
  this has had on children with learning difficulties, especially those who are young and dont understand whats going on. Soo, with all 
  this creativity in my family I thought, what if we tried to write a short (very short) "childrens" book as stories that can maybe 
  better explain to these young people, and even stories that could help them with growing up. Anyway that was my business idea for the 
  day aha! <br>
  Secondly, Large-Scale Evolutionary Optimization, is the optimization of high-dimensional problems. So a method that is mostly used in the 
  literature split the large objective vector into smaller discrete groups and try to optimize each "chunk" of the large-vector on its own. 
  My thought is, what is different dimensions of the problem share similar characteristics? That is, it may be really large problem, but 
  maybe the shape of different dimensions are the same or even have similar optimums for the problem? I wonder if anyone has thought of 
  applying a Multi-Task Evolutionary Algorithm to the decomposed problem instead of the Coevolutionary method that most decomposing algorithms
  use? Anyway, thats my two ideas for today, until next time, Hwyl Fawr!

    Hi everyone (well im assuming atleast one person will read this), this is my first entry of my personal blog. 
    This blog is not going to be me talking about my deepest darkest secrets but more about little ideas I have
    during the day that I think would be interesting to people. I guess the main purpose of this for my is to be 
    an outlet and method of storing thoughts I think may be useful to me or others as a spark of 
    inspiration maybe or most likiely a something people can laugh! Anyway I hope reading my future blogs atleast
    gives you taste of the head space of a PhD Student aha! Also note to self, I need to create the next resources pages!
