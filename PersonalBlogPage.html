      <h6 style="color: rgb(16, 134, 89);">05/03/2021</h6>
      <p>
         Hello everyone (or anyone), so I like to look forward and one of things I do to pass the time is look at houses for
         sale, I know it sounds sad but when theres nothing else to do, thats my go to! So currently Im in Exeter, and one thing
         I will say is the house prices here are outrageous! There are 1 bed tiny flats being sold for like £100,000 - £120,000?
         Like how can they justify those prices? Or even what drives these prices? For that amount of money you can buy a standard 
         2 / 3 bed terraced house from where I'm from in Wales! Now, I know my little town hasn't got he oppertunies for high
         paying jobs, and so maybe thats where you see that properties are purchased at higher prices, but for young people I
         look at it and just feel a little angry. The best opppertunies for young newly-graduated students are mostly in larger 
         cities, but then because of that the demand is higher and the prices and deposits surge and so these young people endup rented and 
         in the long run paying more than if they got a mortgage for a property. So something possible positive from this pandemic 
         that may come out of it is the ability for more people to work from home, and it not become such a luxery. Obviously
         everyone is different and some people may prefer working in an office, but imagine getting a job with a company say in London, 
         and they say you can work from home, with the power of the internet you could like in say Manchester, Nottingham or even South Wales
         and earn a competitive London Salary. And in these regions the prices of rent / houses are far less and I dont know about you, 
         but I would much rather work from a nice 3 bedroon house where I could have my own office, then work in busy company office 
         and live in a small cramped studio apartment in London! Even though i'm still new to the PhD, when I graduate I defineitly 
         going to look for jobs where you can work from home! Hopefully they are still a thing by then!
         Until next time, hwyl fawr!.

      <p>
         Hello everyone (or anyone), so today I was not motivated to work at all,from the moment I woke up I felt tired and 
         my head just not in it. So intead of reading, I decided to exttend on of my repositories MOBO! So I thought in the 
         this blog I'll talk a little about what MOBO is. MOBO stands for MOdular Bayesian Optimization, and when I started 
         implementing this, it was for two reasons, one, a model for me to use easily when I came to carrying out experiments
         for Bayesian Optimization and two, a repository that was clear for people to debug if needed. I'm not going to lie, 
         this implementation is definetly not the best out there, like there are actual company / univeristy funded libraries
         you can use like GPyTorch (facebook) and GPy (Sheffield Univeristy) what I've found whilst trying to find out how 
         they use it is their implementation is complicated! And probably just puts people off trying to understand the 
         process and how to program it! The changes I am planning to implement is the Heteroptopic LCM Multi-Task Gaussian 
         Process, first proposed in 2008 the Multi-Task Gaussian Process leverages similarities between tasks through a 
         covariance function matrix. This matrix is learned through optimizing the log-likelihood. So for now, this is my
         next target....I might implement an moduler Evolutionary Algorithm Library! 
         Until next time, hwyl fawr!.

      <p>
        Hi everyone (well im assuming atleast one person will read this), so I posted my first LinkedIn post giving some "advice" 
        I would give to anyone starting a PhD and so advertise this website. Some of you may quite rightly think, why is he posting adivce posts, 
        he's only done 6 months, no papers published and no evidence that he's achieved beyond what was expected for the first 6 months! But I think 
        its because of those reasons it was worth me posting, to show that no everyone discovers the wheel in their first 6 months, starting a PhD is a 
        big change in lifestyle to most people and the thought of the level of information you will have to self learn can be quite scary! So that's what
        I basically put in the LinkedIn post, and said that perserverence is key, and I truely believe that, if I read a post like that when I was starting
        my Masters it would've given me some comfort I think! Before the actual post, Im not going the lie, I was pooping my pants becuase I didn't know 
        how people would respond to the post. But this fear of sort of public atteptence is silly and will probably hold someone back, so after posting my 
        linked post, my aim is try and post a good update of my progress atleast once every two months, regardless of peoples opinion on the post or my 
        progress. Don;t forget this is your journey into research, no one elses! Until next time, hwyl fawr!.

      <h6 style="color: rgb(16, 134, 89);">25/02/2021</h6>
      <p>
        Hi everyone (well im assuming atleast one person will read this), so as a person I'm always thinking of ways I can make 
        passive income (and to date I have no methods), but I found out that your can upload books to Amazon Kindle for free! 
        (well Amazon get some royalities) So in short, I come from quite a creative family, my mothers a musician, dads and full-time artist 
        my sister is like a wizzz on the Harp and Piano and plays for the UK National Youth Orchestra (<a href="https://www.nyo.org.uk/">link here</a>).
        One of the things I think has gone un-noticed during this Pandemic, or even something that has been given not much attention is the affect 
        this has had on children with learning difficulties, especially those who are young and dont understand whats going on. Soo, with all 
        this creativity in my family I thought, what if we tried to write a short (very short) "childrens" book as stories that can maybe 
        better explain to these young people, and even stories that could help them with growing up. Anyway that was my business idea for the 
        day aha! <br>
        Secondly, Large-Scale Evolutionary Optimization, is the optimization of high-dimensional problems. So a method that is mostly used in the 
        literature split the large objective vector into smaller discrete groups and try to optimize each "chunk" of the large-vector on its own. 
        My thought is, what is different dimensions of the problem share similar characteristics? That is, it may be really large problem, but 
        maybe the shape of different dimensions are the same or even have similar optimums for the problem? I wonder if anyone has thought of 
        applying a Multi-Task Evolutionary Algorithm to the decomposed problem instead of the Coevolutionary method that most decomposing algorithms
        use? Anyway, thats my two ideas for today, until next time, Hwyl Fawr!

        Hi everyone (well im assuming atleast one person will read this), this is my first entry of my personal blog. 
        This blog is not going to be me talking about my deepest darkest secrets but more about little ideas I have
        during the day that I think would be interesting to people. I guess the main purpose of this for my is to be 
        an outlet and method of storing thoughts I think may be useful to me or others as a spark of 
        inspiration maybe or most likiely a something people can laugh! Anyway I hope reading my future blogs atleast
        gives you taste of the head space of a PhD Student aha! Also note to self, I need to create the next resources pages!
